# summary, Lecture 1

# In python, we have objects. Objects in memory can be of different types.
# Types tells python what operations you can do wtih objects.
# Expressions evaluate to one value, and involve objects and operations

# These variables basically binds a name to objects in memory. With objects you can create expressions by combining objects (Facts) with operations.

# Rebinding a variables - does not means modifying the value in the memory, actually it binds the variable with the new memory location. Like

radius = 2.2;
print(radius);
radius = radius + 1; # now variable is pointing to the new memory location.
print(radius);


# Coming towards new Datatype - Strings

var = type(5*4);
print(var);   # now what type of value the "var" stores. ðŸ¤”
