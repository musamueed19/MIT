# In python, program manipulates, Data Objects
# In python, all these are the types of objects.
# 1) int
# 2) float
# 3) string
# 4) bool, have value True or False
# NoneType, have special value "None"

print(type(5));

print(type(3.0));

# We are below, showing how to do Type CAST - convert into another type
# When we are type casting an integer to float, we are changing the int version in the memory. Instead, we are making float version fo that int. and store in a separate place in the memory.
print(float(3));
print(int(3.8));
# This below operation performs implicit cast. truncates the float version, and returns integer version of the float.
print(round(3.5));



# Exercise
print(float(123));
print(round(7.9));
print(float(round(7.2)));
print(int(7.9));
print(int(7.2));
