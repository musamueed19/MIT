1) One of the key way of learning, is at the examples, past examples of both successful & failed projects or designs.

2) What we find at system engineering - often problems begin at the requirements stage.
For Example,
a) requirements are missing
b) there is redundancy
c) in some cases - requirements are written that are overly ambitious

3) Utopian given the time frame and the Budget avaiable

4) So what you have is always a tradeoff between
a) how ambitious your are technically
b) schedule - how much time you have
c) Budget that is available
d) How much you are willing to take the risk

5) Students are pushing the envelope - what is feasible, & what's not feasible, & what we can learn from past failures
