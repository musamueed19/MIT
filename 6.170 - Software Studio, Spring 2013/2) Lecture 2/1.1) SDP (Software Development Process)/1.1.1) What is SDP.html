Software Development Process

"Daniel Jackson"


One of the planning documents for software research revealed --in a parenthetical remark only-- an unchallenged tacit assumption by referring to "the tradeoff between cost and quality". Now in all sorts of mechanical engineering it may make sense to talk about "the tradeoff between cost and quality", in software development this is absolute nonsense, because poor quality is the major contributor to the soaring costs of software development.  (- Dijkstra, EWD690)

<> KEY POINTS <>
-------------------------------
Different Types of SDP are;
1) Waterfall Model, 1970
2) SPIRAL Model, 1986
--- ITERATIVE & INCREMENTAL Development, 2003 ---
1) V Model
2) Extreme Programming, 1999
3) AGILE Appraches, 2001

--------------------------------

---- The WATERFALL Model, 1970 ----
from: Winston Royce, "Managing the Development of Large Software Systems"
Proceeding of IEEE WESCON 26 (August): 1-9, 1970.

The Stages of an IDEAL Waterfall model are;
1) System Requirements
2) Software Requirements
3) Analysis (i.e., Bussines Logic)
4) Program Design
5) Coding
6) Testing
7) Operations

---- What Royce actually said ----
Waterfall model with iterative interactions restricted to successive steps (i.e., between Adjacent Stages)

---- What happens in practice ----
Waterfall model in practice, iterations are not restricted to Successive steps. (i.e, From "Testing" to back "Program Design", or from "Program Design" to back "Software Requirements").


---- Royce's fixes ----

Program Design comes first:
1) Do some design between "Requirements" and "Analysis" Phase

------
Document the Design:
1) How much? "my own view is quite a lot"

------
Do it Twice:
1) "If the computer program in question is being developed in first time, arrange matters so that the version finally delivered to the customer for operational deployment is actually the second version insofar as critical (design/operations) areas are concerned"

------
Plan, Control and Monitor Testing:
1) With a separate Testing team

------
Involve the Customer:
1) "In a formal way, committed... at earlier points before final delivery"





--------- SPIRAL Model, 1986 ----------
--------- Origins of Iterative Approaches ----------

Plan-Do-Study-Act:
1) Shewart, 1930s
2) Deming, 1940s

------
Project Mercury:
1) NASA, 1960s
2) Half-day iterations
3) Test before each tier
4) became IBM Federal System Division 


1) PLAN:
1) Objective
2) Predictions
3) Plan to carry out the cycle (who, what, where, when)
4) Plan for Data Collection

----------
2) DO:
1) Carry out the Plan
2) Document Observations
3) Record Data

----------
3) STUDY:
1) Analyze data
2) Compare Results to predictions
3) Summarise what was learned

---------
4) ACT:
1) What changes are to be made?
2) Next cycle?


----  V Model ----
Tests are developed in Early phases, applied in later phases
